## There are two functions in this code that cache the inverse of a matrix.
## One is makeCacheMatrix and another is cacheSolve

## makecacheMatrix function creates a special matrix object that can cache its 
## inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve function computes the inverse of the special matrix returns by 
## makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse is already computed then the cacheMatrix 
## function retrieves the inverse from cache. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
